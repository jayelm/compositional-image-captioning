This repository contains models for image captioning. 

Currently, there is a Pytorch implementation of the [Show, Attend and Tell](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044) model
(adapted from a [PyTorch Tutorial to Image Captioning](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning)).

## Experiments

Descriptions and results of performed experiments can be found in the [experiments directory](experiments/). Some overview
of the data used to run the experiments can be found in the [data directory](data/).
